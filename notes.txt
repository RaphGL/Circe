todo:

- immediate: 
    click-drag-move
    area selection - contains and intersects by selection area is positive/negative
    device/wire copy/paste
    ctrl-z/undo/redo

    build script to copy ngspice.dll into directory

    zooming during device placement visual bug - maybe selection system not a good fit

    traits for nets, devices, baseElement - org and tech debt
    edit device parameters rework - json serde, self contained

    make code/comment pristine - then code review

- medium term:
    device designer, device saving/loading, device libraries

    logging

    use pane_grid from iced
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

- long term:
    custom net names
    nets highlighting/color cycling

    bypass iced, tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling (maybe?)

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support

    wiring pathfinder
    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections)
