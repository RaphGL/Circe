todo:

- immediate:
    unify draw/stroke interface
    (tech debt)

    add device modal window
    add gnd, voltage source devices (g, v)
    generate netlist
    device parameters
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

- medium term:

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

    feed netlist to NgSpice simulator

    device/wire copy/paste

- long term:

    device designer, device saving/loading, device libraries
    
    custom net names
    nets highlighting/color cycling

    bypass iced and tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support

    wiring pathfinder
    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections)
