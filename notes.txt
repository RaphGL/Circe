    mouse hover preview highlight in any state (wiring, etc)
    terminate line seg on wiring to a port

    moving/grabbing devices and wires (m)

    named nets, canvas text
    add gnd, voltage source devices (g, v)

- medium term:
    generate netlist
    device parameters
    feed netlist to NgSpice simulator

- long term:
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    device designer, device saving/loading, device libraries

    bypass iced and tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling

notes about selections:
    storing elements in a state enum works well enough when there is one
    would it work well for a vec? - try
    parallel schematic for selected elements?
