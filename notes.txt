todo:

- immediate: 
    zooming during device placement visual bug - maybe selection system not a good fit

    make code/comment pristine - then code review
    traits for nets, devices, baseElement - org and tech debt
    edit device parameters rework

- medium term:
    use pane_grid from iced
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

    device/wire copy/paste

- long term:

    device designer, device saving/loading, device libraries

    logging
    
    custom net names
    nets highlighting/color cycling

    bypass iced and tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support

    wiring pathfinder
    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections)
