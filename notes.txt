todo:

- schematic: 
    click-drag-move
    area selection - contains and intersects by selection area is positive/negative
    device/wire copy/paste
    connect devices with wire if ports overlap
    ctrl-z/undo/redo
    wiring pathfinder
    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections)

- immediate: 
    zooming during device placement visual bug - maybe selection system not a good fit, or just flag phantom devices to not draw?

    org and tech debt - make code/comment pristine - then code review

    device designer, place ports, device saving/loading, device libraries
    devices rework - json serde graphics

- medium term:
    build script to copy ngspice.dll into directory

    logging

    use pane_grid from iced
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

- long term:
    custom net names
    nets highlighting/color cycling

    bypass iced, tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling (maybe?)

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support
