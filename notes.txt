todo:

- immediate:
    unify schematic interations to SSPoint

    display device identifier

    traits for nets, devices, baseElement

    add gnd, voltage source devices (g, v)
    device parameters
    side panel device parameters edit
    generate netlist
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    separate net names when split by a device

- medium term:

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

    feed netlist to NgSpice simulator

    device/wire copy/paste

- long term:

    device designer, device saving/loading, device libraries

    logging
    
    custom net names
    nets highlighting/color cycling

    bypass iced and tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support

    wiring pathfinder
    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections)
