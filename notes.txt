todo:

- immediate:
    move some logic into main (?)
    unify draw/stroke interface
    (tech debt)
    rework events handling

    named nets, canvas text

- medium term:
    add gnd, voltage source devices (g, v)
    generate netlist
    device parameters
    feed netlist to NgSpice simulator

    device/wire copy/paste

- long term:
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    device designer, device saving/loading, device libraries

    bypass iced and tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support

    wiring pathfinder

    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections)

notes about selections:
    storing elements in a state enum works well enough when there is one
    would it work well for a vec? - try
    parallel schematic for selected elements?
