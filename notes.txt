todo:

- immediate:
    rotate while moving - unify device placement and moving systems
    instancing: clear selected, new device in selected, enter move mode
    moving: enter move mode

    traits for nets, devices, baseElement - org and tech debt


- medium term:
    separate net names when split by a device

    add voltage source (v)
    device parameters
    side panel device parameters edit
    generate netlist
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

    feed netlist to NgSpice simulator

    device/wire copy/paste

- long term:

    device designer, device saving/loading, device libraries

    logging
    
    custom net names
    nets highlighting/color cycling

    bypass iced and tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support

    wiring pathfinder
    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections)
